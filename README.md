## Task Completion History

### January 2, 2023

- Design mockup
- HTML
- Styling

I wanted to start this project off on the right foot, which meant coming up with a design for this web application. I wanted something modern and minimalistic, but still visually appealing. I eventually came up with a design on Figma that used a muted slate blue palette, as I know harsh colours aren't always easy on the eye.

I wrote the foundational HTML markup of the application, and completed the majority of the styling.
