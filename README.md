# Morse Code Translator

## Task Completion History

### January 3, 2023

- Added Morse code to English translation functionality
- Refactored code and created separate JavaScript files for related functions
- Added copy-to-clipboard feature

Based on feedback from my FakeOS project, I created individual JavaScript documents to house functions based on how they were related to one another. Initially, I had a single `script.js` file containing all of my JavaScript functions, but then moved them into their respective place.

While moving the functions out of `script.js`, I took the liberty of refactoring my code wherever obvious. One of my next short-term goals is to thoroughly review my code to refactor it further and increase its readability.

I also thought about quality-of-life features such as copying to clipboard buttons, and added this function to the webpage.

- Design mockup
- HTML
- Styling
- Begun basic English to Morse code translation functionality

I wanted to start this project off on the right foot, which meant coming up with a design for this web application. I wanted something modern and minimalistic, but still visually appealing. I eventually came up with a design on Figma that used a muted slate blue palette, as I know harsh colours aren't always easy on the eye.

I wrote the foundational HTML markup of the application, completed the majority of the styling, and started the English to Morse code translation feature.
